# LeadScoring
Objective

Professionals can purchase online courses from X Education. On any given day, a large number of professionals who are interested in the courses visit their website and search for courses. The company promotes its courses on various websites and search engines such as Google. When these users arrive at the website, they may browse the courses, fill out a course registration form, or watch some videos. These persons are regarded as leads when they fill out a form with their email address or phone number. Furthermore, the organisation receives leads from previous referrals. Once these leads are obtained, members of the sales team begin making calls, composing emails, and so on. Some leads are converted throughout this procedure, whereas the majority are not.
